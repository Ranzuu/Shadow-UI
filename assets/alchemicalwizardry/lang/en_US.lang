# Blood Altar Progression
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.1.a=§7The Blood Altar is the bleeding heart of Blood Magic: Alchemical Wizardry.\n\nTo begin your journey to immense power, place it in the world and use a Sacrificial Knife while standing close to the altar to turn 1 heart into raw Life Essence.
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.1.b=§7The Blood Altar is the bleeding heart of Blood Magic: Alchemical Wizardry.\n\nTo begin your journey to immense power, place it in the world and use a Sacrificial Orb while standing close to the altar to turn 1 heart into raw Life Essence.
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.2=§7Once the Blood Altar holds enough Life Essence, you may place an item inside with right-click. Compatible offerings will absorb Life Essence from the altar and be transmuted. Items can be removed with an empty hand. They may also be inserted and extracted with hoppers and pipes.
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.3=§7Alongside its main crafting pool, the Blood Altar has two internal fluid buffers: one for input, one for output. Life Essence will slowly seep between the altar's main storage and buffers, which handle all interactions with any manner of fluid pipe or pump. Both buffers have a capacity of 1/10th of the altar's main pool.
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.4=§7Your first offering should be used to create a Weak Blood Orb. Once created, right-click with it in hand to bind it to your soul. Once bound, it can be placed in the Blood Altar to add life essence to your Soul Network in the form of LP.
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.5=§7The Blood Altar may be strengthened with Blood Runes. Construct a 3x3 ring beneath its base to reach Tier 2. Each new tier awakens greater transmutations.
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.6=§7Upgrading the Blood Altar to Tier 3 requires 20 additional Runes in a 7x7 ring (centered on the altar, place 5 on each side) placed one block below the previous ring. Place two-block tall pillars in the corners made from any material and cap them with blocks of Glowstone. The gaps between rings of Runes may be filled by any cosmetic block, or nothing at all.
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.7=§7Upgrading the Blood Altar to Tier 4 requires 28 additional Runes in an 11x11 ring (centered on the altar, place 7 on each side) placed one block below the previous ring. Place four-block tall pillars in the corners made from any material and cap them with Large Bloodstone Bricks. The Bloodstone should stand one block above the Glowstone.
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.8=§7Upgrading the Blood Altar to Tier 5 requires 52 additional Runes in a 17x17 ring (centered on the altar, place 13 on each side) placed one block below the previous ring. Place one Beacon in each corner, one block above the Runes. The altar's structure can accommodate the maximum size beacon base for all four beacons.
nei.infopage.bloodAltar.9=§7Upgrading the Blood Altar to Tier 6 requires 76 additional Runes in a 23x23 ring (centered on the altar, place 19 on each side) placed one block below the previous ring. Place seven-block tall pillars in the corners made from any material and cap them with Crystal Cluster blocks. These caps should stand one block above the Bloodstone used for Tier 4.
# Incense
nei.infopage.incense.1=§7The Incense Crucible empowers self-sacrifice. Place one near your Blood Altar for each type of incense you will use, and add them with right-click. The flames and colored smoke will fade once the incense is ready. Multiple crucibles with the same incense will burn faster, charging more quickly.
nei.infopage.incense.2.a=§7Burning incense lasts for about 10 sacrifices. Your Sacrificial Knife will start to glow as the incense burns. While active, using your knife drains all but the last 10% of your health at once, greatly increasing the LP gained. This leaves you with the Soul Fray effect for a short time, preventing further sacrifices.
nei.infopage.incense.2.b=§7Burning incense lasts for about 10 sacrifices. Your Sacrificial Orb will start to glow as the incense burns. While active, using your orb drains all but the last 10% of your health at once, greatly increasing the LP gained. This leaves you with the Soul Fray effect for a short time, preventing further sacrifices.
nei.infopage.incense.3=§7Incense increases the LP gained compared to normal sacrifices. Each tier requires the previous, and grants the following bonus when fully charged:\n\nWood Ash: 40%\nByrrus: 80%\nLivens: 150%\nViridis: 240%\nPurpura: 350%
# Sacrifices
nei.infopage.sacrifice.1=§7The Dagger of Sacrifice channels the life of others into the Blood Altar. Strike a creature with the dagger while it is near the altar, and it will be slain instantly, pouring its essence into the altar's pool.
nei.infopage.sacrifice.2=§7Creatures yield Life Essence according to their vitality: animals give the least, monsters give more, and villagers offer the greatest. Bosses, babies, and other players resist this magic and cannot be sacrificed.
nei.infopage.sacrifice.3=§7Mechanical hands are unable to wield the Dagger of Sacrifice with the finesse it requires. For automatic sacrifices, seek the Well of Suffering ritual.
# Altar Runes
nei.infopage.rune.augmentedCapacity=§7The Rune of Augmented Capacity increases the altar's maximum storage by 3500 LP per rune. This bonus applies after Superior Capacity's.\n\nIncreasing the altar's capacity also increases the size of its input and output buffers by a proportional amount.
nei.infopage.rune.dislocation=§7The Rune of Dislocation accelerates the flow of essence between the altar and its buffers, increasing transfer by 50% per rune, stacking multiplicatively. The altar's veins strain, pushing blood faster through every channel.
nei.infopage.rune.orb=§7The Rune of the Orb strengthens the link between altar and Soul Network. Each rune temporarily increases the inserted Blood Orb's maximum LP capacity by 4% per rune, stacking additively. Pushing the limits is required to achieve ultimate power.
nei.infopage.rune.superiorCapacity=§7The Rune of Superior Capacity increases the altar's base storage by 14% per rune, stacking multiplicatively. With enough runes, the altar may hold oceans of Life Essence.
nei.infopage.rune.acceleration=§7The Rune of Acceleration hastens interactions with the altar's fluid buffers. Normally, they cycle fluid once per second; each rune reduces this delay by 1 tick.\n\nThe effect caps after 19 runes, allowing for a ceaseless torrent of Life Essence.
nei.infopage.rune.quickness=§7The Rune of Quickness shortens the five-second pause between transmutations by 20%, stacking multiplicatively.\n\nThe effect caps after 18 runes. Unfortunately, the Blood Altar is unable to break the laws of time...
nei.infopage.rune.speed=§7The Rune of Speed increases the rate at which the altar infuses essence into offerings by 25% per rune, stacking additively. A little haste never hurt anybody.
nei.infopage.rune.efficiency=§7The Rune of Efficiency is shrouded in mystery. It is inert, unobtainable, and its purpose is long forgotten.
nei.infopage.rune.sacrifice=§7The Rune of Sacrifice increases LP gained from sacrifices by 12% per rune, stacking additively. With enough runes, every offering yields rivers of blood.
nei.infopage.rune.selfSacrifice=§7The Rune of Self-Sacrifice empowers offerings of one's own blood, granting 12% more LP per rune, stacking additively. Through pain comes power.
nei.infopage.rune.blank=§7Blood Runes serve as the foundation of every altar. Though plain at first, they may be replaced with specialized runes that amplify the altar's capabilities, such as the Rune of Sacrifice, which grants more essence when blood is spilled with a Dagger of Sacrifice or the Well of Suffering ritual.
# Progression Items
nei.infopage.bloodShards=§7Weak Blood Shards, which are required for the Bloodstone Bricks and Master Blood Orb used to progress your altar to Tier 4, are dropped by creatures slain while under the effect of Weakness III or higher. This effect is impossible through traditional means of potion brewing, but a Bound Blade or Potion Flask will be able to apply such an effect.
nei.infopage.demonShards.1=§7Demon Blood Shards are required for the Archmage Blood Orb and Awakened Activation Crystal. To summon the beings that carry them, place a bound Master Blood Orb (or higher) upon an Arcane Plinth, and surround it with six Arcane Pedestals, each holding the same reagent.
nei.infopage.demonShards.2=§7The pedestals must be placed in the outer ring of a 5x5 area, with the Arcane Plinth at the center. This forms a hexagonal pattern. After the ritual has been prepared, lightning will strike each pedestal in turn before the Elemental manifests. The reagent used determines the type of Elemental called forth.
nei.infopage.demonShards.3=§7Elementals are flying, durable creatures with 100 HP that will attack on sight. They can attack from a distance and embody the powers of their element in battle. They need not be slain with a Bound Blade to yield Demon Blood Shards, though drops are not guaranteed. The Looting enchantment increases the chance.
nei.infopage.convocationShards=§7The Soul and Life Shards required for the Crystal Clusters used to upgrade the altar to Tier 6 are dropped by Demon Grunts summoned by the Convocation of the Damned ritual. Only those who command demons may bring an altar to its ultimate perfection.
# Blood Orb / Soul Network Explanation
nei.infopage.bloodOrbs.1=§7Blood Orbs are the vessels of your Soul Network. When you create one in the Blood Altar, right-click with it in hand to bind it to yourself.
nei.infopage.bloodOrbs.2=§7Once bound, place your Blood Orb into the altar. Any Life Essence you pour in, whether by self-sacrifice, dagger, or ritual, will be stored in your personal Soul Network as LP, ready for use by mystical items, powerful sigils, alchemic chemistry, and rituals.
nei.infopage.bloodOrbs.3=§7Higher tiers of Blood Orbs unlock new recipes. Each orb also has its own maximum LP that it can insert into your Soul Network, which may temporarily be expanded by placing it in a Blood Altar augmented with Runes of the Orb.
nei.infopage.bloodOrbs.4=§7Your Soul Network is invisible to the eye, but its presence can be felt. Many rituals, sigils, and magical devices will draw directly from your LP. If your network runs dry, the power will be taken from your own life instead. A Divination Sigil may be used to see your current LP.
# Rituals
nei.infopage.rituals.weak.1=§7Rituals are the next step on your path to power. Right-clicking the Imperfect Ritual Stone will call down lightning and create the following effects when placed beneath the correct block, at the cost of 5,000 LP.
nei.infopage.rituals.weak.2=§7Water Source: Summon a thunderstorm\nBlock of Coal: Summon an empowered zombie\nLapis Lazuli Block: Shift the time to night\nBedrock: Grant Resistance II for 1 minute
nei.infopage.rituals.1=§7While it has its uses, the Imperfect Ritual Stone is a curiosity of limited power, since it can only draw strength from the block directly above it. The Master Ritual Stone, by contrast, is capable of channeling energy from many surrounding Ritual Stones.
nei.infopage.rituals.2=§7To build a ritual, place a Master Ritual Stone surrounded by Ritual Stones, and inscribe them with Elemental Inscription Tools. A Ritual Diviner may instead be used to automatically place the stones and inscribe them correctly.
nei.infopage.rituals.3=§7Once the ritual is assembled, right-click the Master Ritual Stone with a bound Activation Crystal. If everything is in place and your Soul Network contains sufficient LP, the ritual will commence! Each ritual has a unique effect. Experimentation is encouraged to discover the full potential of the Master Ritual Stone.
nei.infopage.reagents.1=§7Some rituals can be modified by providing reagents to the Master Ritual Stone. However, raw reagents are too impure to be used directly. They must first be refined in an Alchemic Calcinator into AR (Alchemy Reagent), a pure essence usable by the ritual.
nei.infopage.reagents.2=§7To use an Alchemic Calcinator, right-click it with a bound Blood Orb, and then right-click it with the reagent item. Reagents may also be inserted via hoppers or pipes. The reagent will be consumed and converted into AR, which the Calcinator will store internally.
nei.infopage.reagents.3=§7An Alchemic Router is required to transfer AR. Shift-right-click a block containing AR to attune the Router to that reagent. Then right-click the source block, followed by the destination block, to create a link. Shift-right-click in the air to remove the currently saved source.
nei.infopage.reagents.4=§7An Alchemic Cleanser may be used to remove AR links by using it on the source block. An Alchemic Segmenter may be used to limit how many internal AR tanks a single reagent may occupy; it is attuned in the same way as the Router.
nei.infopage.reagents.5=§7The range of AR links is limited to a few blocks. To extend the transfer distance, use Alchemic Relays. Crystal Belljars may be placed to store AR, and they will retain their contents when broken.
